# keiner type specimen
a type specimen i created for Hanken Design Co's typeface, Keiner.

### the concept
Keiner is a versatile typeface, made both for signages, printing and digital formats; and since Hanken Design Co is a digital typefoundry with aglobal clientele, I thought the best way to approach the type specimen brief, was to put it on the www.

Keiner is a geometric, mono-lined typeface with hardly any optical corrections or stem contrasts, yet, because of it 7 different styles, it still works as a versatile type, and can work from anything from larger signages, to logos, headlines and body texts. This juxtaposition of rigid-ness and flexibility prompted me to design the website following a strict grid and a minimal colour palette, with interactive and playful features.
